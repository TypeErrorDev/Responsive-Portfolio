# Responsive Portfolio

Okay, so welcome to my Week 2 project! This is version 7 of this project for me. I believe that this will be my final version _fingers crossed_

I am aiming for an Exceeds Expectations on this project. If I do not obtain the Exceeds Expectations grade, please mark my project as Needs Work.

My main struggle so far on this project was definitely using Flexbox, and organizing my CSS. I feel like my CSS works, but is HORRIBLY written. I will be making it a focus to clean my code up in the future projects.

When giving feedback, please dont hold back the critique. I know my code is not visually pleasing or up to standards, and I'm all ears on how to improve my process and routine while coding.
